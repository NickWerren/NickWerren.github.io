      <description>The following is a partial transcription of a series of interviews conducted by Paula Crossfield with the late David Berman.
  Paula Crossfield: Before, we were talking about your process. In particular you were talking about &amp;ldquo;Smith and Jones&amp;rdquo; - looking at it as a way in to describing your writing process. You described working at The Whitney, and your twenty-lines-a-day, and having ten years&#39; worth of books. And then you started describing the actual nuts and bolts of how you were working on American Water so maybe we can go back to that.</description>

      <description>The following is a partial transcription of a series of interviews conducted by Paula Crossfield with the late David Berman.
  Paula Crossfield: Hi, David?
David Berman: Hey Paula.
PC: Thank you so much for taking the time and for getting back to me so quickly.
DB: I was just reading about your Kickstarter campaign and I was wondering how it went?
PC: Well, we got it. We got $100,000 for our little food blog that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for 5 years and now I can make it a sustainable job, and hire somebody, and pay my writers which I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about!</description>

The core members of The Good Ones are Adrien Kazigira, Javan Mahoro, and Janvier Havugimana. Each are a member of the nation&amp;rsquo;s divided social groups - Hutu, Tutsi, and Abatwa. The origins of the former two, Hutu and Tutsi, are incredibly controversial and ultimately a tool used to peddle conflict.</description>

      <description>Daniel Johnston&amp;rsquo;s most famous single piece of work is his album Hi, How Are You. It was recorded in his brother&amp;rsquo;s garage and features a makeshift recording apparatus made from a chord organ and a couple of tape recorders strapped to a weight bench. Johnston started out as a musical scavenger, shrugging off structure he completely disregarded convention to create something unique in this album. The result is songs like Big Monkey Business, Walking The Cow and Hey Joe that absolutely lie on the right side of lo-fi genius.</description>

Peddlers of dreamy sex-groove, Rhye, have released their song Black Rain in preparation for the release of their new album Home. It&amp;rsquo;s a composition of all the best parts of their back catalogue: Mike Milosh&amp;rsquo;s trademark falsetto vocals, deep synth, and elegant strings. The song wonderfully changes tempo, switching between texture and speed whilst remaining groovy.</description>

      <description>This article was previously published in Incite Journal.
  A little while ago, I was having a discussion with my friends in which we attempted to identify the landmark moments in music that defined the last decade. One thing we all agreed upon was that Old Town Road by Lil Nas X was a cultural touchstone that careered though the musical landscape. This led me to return to the song.</description>

      <description>A still from the video for Sparkle Hard: The Movie.
  
In 2018, Stephen Malkmus released what I rate as a near-perfect album, Sparkle Hard, his seventh with The Jicks. If you know Malkmus, it&amp;rsquo;s likely that you&amp;rsquo;re aware of Pavement. Pavement were a quintessential sound of the 90&amp;rsquo;s, and Stephen Malkmus was the nucleus of that project. I imagine it must be super annoying to have work you produced several decades ago referenced in every new release, so let&amp;rsquo;s move on from Pavement and talk about Sparkle Hard.</description>

      <description>A still from the video for Free. Copyright 2020 Loma Vista Recordings.
  
To put it concisely, Sylvan Esso are a savvy artistic duo composed of Amelia Meath and Nick Sanborn. The project is the marriage of Meath&amp;rsquo;s silken vocals with Sanborn&amp;rsquo;s gravelled synth. Sometimes her voice is shattered and interspliced, other times it is allowed to ebb and flow around the electronic instrumentals. Freedom and structure are intertwined like ice water passing through a glacier.</description>

Anderson .Paak raised a fist earlier this year and crystalised our moment in history with the most powerful track of 2020: Lockdown. Two weeks ago, he returned with JEWELZ. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun track, the slapping bass and vocoder produce a feel that would&amp;rsquo;ve allowed it to comfortably slip into a playlist for the summer we never had. JEWELZ is contrasted by my next pick, I&amp;rsquo;ve Made Up My Mind.</description>

      <description>A still from the video for Darkness &amp;amp; Cold
  
The first songs I heard from David Berman were the singles released in advance of his Purple Mountains project. It shone like dark neon; the songs dazzled as they whirled between bleak honesty and being honestly bleak. It was clear that he was wrestling with despair but still managed to find humour in the depths of it all.</description>

Nobody knows who discovered Venus, our celestial neighbour and the second planet from the Sun, it&amp;rsquo;s been a feature of human culture since time immemorial. Its scientific name is an artifact of the Roman association of the planet, which they called Luciferus, with the goddess of beauty, Venus. In the first half of the 20th century, books like C.</description>

      <description>This article was previously published in Incite Journal and The Guildford Dragon.
  A few weeks ago I was adrift amongst the aisles of Marks &amp;amp; Spencer. I don’t get paid very much, my rent is high, and my trousers had rips in all the wrong places. I was contemplating whether or not I could justify buying a new pair. I decided that I could proceed in three ways:</description>

      <description>As I’m sure you know, the Sun is a bundle of particles experiencing incredibly high levels of heat, gravity, and confusion. This provides a situation that is hectic to say the least. And so, just like your average Joe, to blow off steam the Sun will occasionally blow off an unimaginable amount of charged plasma. The charged particles that constitute this plasma radiate out from the Sun and hurtle towards the orbiting planets.</description>

      <description>As I’m sure you’re aware the sky is blue, clouds are white, and sunsets are red.
Why does this happen?
The Earth’s atmosphere is 78% Nitrogen, 21% Oxygen, a pinch of Argon and then a sprinkling of various other gases. So, our atmosphere is mostly Nitrogen and Oxygen, and the atoms of these gases generally like to wander around in twos. This is what we call a molecule, and both molecules are joined by a chemical bond that is about 300 picometres long (tiny!</description>

      <title>If It Looks Like A Duck</title>

      <description>As science continues to bound through the 21st century, its frontiers stretch ever further towards distant conceptual horizons. The borders dividing the nations of science become increasingly distorted in the lands that inhabit these distinctly foreign frontiers. One region that inspires deep trepidation in the researchers who explore this realm, and endless suspicion from their colleagues, is where quantum mechanics crashes into systems biology to create quantum biology. Research into this tectonic collision of physics and biology began relatively recently, and is raising eyebrows across both fields.</description>

As you read this, electricity is being channelled from its source and into your screen. This source is likely to be a turbine which is spinning in the heart of a generator somewhere, converting the mechanical energy of its rotation into electrical energy. Imagine it happening now. Imagine a hydropower plant like this one.</description>

What lurks at the centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way? It&amp;rsquo;s a big question with an even bigger answer. Supermassive, in fact, as identified by Prof. Andrea Ghez and Prof. Reinhard Genzel. The two astronomers were key players in making the discovery: That a supermassive object lurks at the centre of our galaxy, likely a black hole.</description>
