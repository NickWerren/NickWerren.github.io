      <description>The following is a partial transcription of a series of interviews conducted by Paula Crossfield with the late David Berman.
  Paula Crossfield: Before, we were talking about your process. In particular you were talking about &amp;ldquo;Smith and Jones&amp;rdquo; - looking at it as a way in to describing your writing process. You described working at The Whitney, and your twenty-lines-a-day, and having ten years&#39; worth of books. And then you started describing the actual nuts and bolts of how you were working on American Water so maybe we can go back to that.</description>

      <description>The following is a partial transcription of a series of interviews conducted by Paula Crossfield with the late David Berman.
  Paula Crossfield: Hi, David?
David Berman: Hey Paula.
PC: Thank you so much for taking the time and for getting back to me so quickly.
DB: I was just reading about your Kickstarter campaign and I was wondering how it went?
PC: Well, we got it. We got $100,000 for our little food blog that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for 5 years and now I can make it a sustainable job, and hire somebody, and pay my writers which I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about!</description>

      <description>Daniel Johnston&amp;rsquo;s most famous single piece of work is his album Hi, How Are You. It was recorded in his brother&amp;rsquo;s garage and features a makeshift recording apparatus made from a chord organ and a couple of tape recorders strapped to a weight bench. Johnston started out as a musical scavenger, shrugging off structure he completely disregarded convention to create something unique in this album. The result is songs like Big Monkey Business, Walking The Cow and Hey Joe that absolutely lie on the right side of lo-fi genius.</description>

  A little while ago, I was having a discussion with my friends in which we attempted to identify the landmark moments in music that defined the last decade. One thing we all agreed upon was that Old Town Road by Lil Nas X was a cultural touchstone that careered though the musical landscape. This led me to return to the song.</description>

  A few weeks ago I was adrift amongst the aisles of Marks &amp;amp; Spencer. I don’t get paid very much, my rent is high, and my trousers had rips in all the wrong places. I was contemplating whether or not I could justify buying a new pair. I decided that I could proceed in three ways:</description>

      <description>As I’m sure you know, the Sun is a bundle of particles experiencing incredibly high levels of heat, gravity, and confusion. This provides a situation that is hectic to say the least. And so, just like your average Joe, to blow off steam the Sun will occasionally blow off an unimaginable amount of charged plasma. The charged particles that constitute this plasma radiate out from the Sun and hurtle towards the orbiting planets.</description>

      <title>Scattered Colours of the Sky</title>

      <description>As I’m sure you’re aware the sky is blue, clouds are white, and sunsets are red.
Why does this happen?
The Earth’s atmosphere is 78% Nitrogen, 21% Oxygen, a pinch of Argon and then a sprinkling of various other gases. So, our atmosphere is mostly Nitrogen and Oxygen, and the atoms of these gases generally like to wander around in twos. This is what we call a molecule, and both molecules are joined by a chemical bond that is about 300 picometres long (tiny!</description>

      <description>As science continues to bound through the 21st century, its frontiers stretch ever further towards distant conceptual horizons. The borders dividing the nations of science become increasingly distorted in the lands that inhabit these distinctly foreign frontiers. One region that inspires deep trepidation in the researchers who explore this realm, and endless suspicion from their colleagues, is where quantum mechanics crashes into systems biology to create quantum biology. Research into this tectonic collision of physics and biology began relatively recently, and is raising eyebrows across both fields.</description>
